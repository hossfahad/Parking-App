Parko: Parking Made Easier (CUNY HACKATHON SPRING '18)


Created an application for CUNY Hackathon Spring 2018.

Parko - Parking Made Easier

Team Members: Richard Amin () , Irina Fedorova ()

Summary: For the CUNY Hackathon, our prompt was to find a way to make New Yorkers lives a bit easier. So our plan was to develop Parko with the intention to save time. In New York, time is one of our biggest assets. Parko is a user-exchanged parking app. Users may exchange parking spots from other drivers and vice-versa from street parking, to parking garages and even driveways.

That means having more time to do what you need or want to. That means no waiting or driving around trying to find one spot. That also means not being late for events, work or burning an absurd amount of time and gas.

Our goal is to implement a platform where New Yorkers can help each other by exchanging parking spots with one another, including both street parking and driveways. This will save time, gas and energy for New Yorkers.

Built with - 
- Hybrid mobile app development: Cordova, PhoneGap with the assistance of HTML/CSS/Javascript.
- Used localstorage to hold data but plan to use Firebase for DB
- Used Google Maps API and TurfJS.
